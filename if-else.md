if & else blocks are used for conditionals as in every programming language Go also supports.

### If else Syntax

```
 x:="hello"

if x=="hello"{    Paranthesis is not required as in every language brackets are required even though there is only one line in if block. 
fmt.Println("Equal")
}

else if x=="Hello"{
fmt.Println("Not Equal")
}

```
