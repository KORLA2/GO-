Every Go Program contains 

1. **Package main**
   In Go, the main package is a special package used to indicate that the program is executable (i.e., it will produce a runnable binary).

2. **import "fmt"**
     Imports the fmt (formatting) package from the standard library. It allows us to use fmt.Println , fmt.Scan etc .. functions to print and read from console.

3. **func main()**
    Defines the main function, the entry point for a Go program.

   Go code generally runs faster than interpreted languages and compiles faster than other compiled languages.
